# TextEditor

The text editor was built using React, MongoDB, socket.io, and quill JS, and we used create-react-app to generate the initial boilerplate code. When the client runs the text editor, it shows a toolbar and an A4 size editor where users can write and edit text. The URL of the page includes a document ID, which allows users with the same document ID to edit the same document concurrently. This allows for real-time collaboration on the same document, similar to how google docs works.
